# RandomCertsandStuff

Finished the USAF Cybersec challenges. I overthought every single one. The first one was simple fuzzing type while I wasted 4 hours figuring out and brushing up on SQL Injections. The second one I started doing frequency analysis and wondering if position was important, when it was just a classic cipher that I was reading about in the book Code by Simon Signh. For the third, I was looking into the hexdata to see if there was something hidden there or in the binary or rgb values but in fact it was a simpler bit mask type.
