# RandomCertsandStuff

Finished the USAF Cybersec challenges. I overthought every single one.


The first one was simple fuzzing type while I wasted 4 hours figuring out and brushing up on SQL Injections and going to bed frustrated.


The second one I started doing frequency analysis and wondering if letter position in the matrix was important, when it was just a classic cipher that I was reading about in the book Code by Simon Singh.


For the third, I was looking into the hexdata to see if there was something hidden there or in the binary or rgb values, I even looked up the address on the second picture wondering if the street section could be a hint but in fact it was a simpler bit mask type.


Overall frustrating but informative.
